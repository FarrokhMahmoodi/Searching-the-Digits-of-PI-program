This program prompts an interactive user for her 5 digit zipcode, reads in that zipcode, and verifies that 5 digits have been entered. If 5 digits are not entered, the program writes an error message to the screen, and reprompts. The original prompt should give explicit directions for the interactive user.
Once a five digit code (presumably a zipcode) has been correctly entered, your program should then generate and search the digits of pi, checking for the entered zipcode. When those numbers, in exactly the right order, are found, the program should write out at which digit the zipcode started. Pi starts out as 3.1 and continues. Consider 3 digit #1, the 1 after the decimal place as digit #2, and so forth. After informing the interactive user where her zipcode first appears in the digits of pi, your program should stop.
Although it has not been proven, it is suspected that any finite string of numbers can be found somewhere in the elaboration of pi. However, it can take a long time to find any particular number. To avoid very long waits, stop looking for a particular zipcode after you have generated 10,000,000 digits of pi
